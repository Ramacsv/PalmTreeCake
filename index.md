## SuteCase's CLCO


_My friend Suitecase walking along the palm tree grove in Oahu Hawaii_

_Find out what is CLCO later_

_An Ape sitting on the palm tree dropped a paper sheet._

_It was a list of ingredients. It turned out to be a recipe for a cake_

_He read the recipe and said wow! this is what I wanted_

_He got some ingredients himself from the store_

_And some from cloud island by calling his mom_

_She sent it through cookie monster_

_This cake has seven layers with top cloud icing_

_The base is special cloud leaf made of C12H22O11 mould_ xdhclfhf

C16H11N2NaO4S - Orange
C101H142N24O26S Kiwi
C12H14O3 Strawberry
C6H8O7 Lemon Citrus
C12H24O2 + CH3(CH2)12COOH + C16H32O2 + C18H34O2 + C18H32O2   = Coconut
C27H31O16  Bluberry
C17H16O6  Peach

_The fun part is collecting all the ingredients, he took it to cookie monster and gonger kitchen_

_Cookie maonster started help with mixing flour_

_While sifting and stirring he scaterred all over the plane and on himself_

-So Suitecase had to clean up and started mixing by himself_

_For the cake he used flour, milk powder,butter, salt, sugar, baking power, and his secret ingredient too_

_that gives a special taste_
