## SuteCase's CLCO


_My friend Suitecase walking along the palm tree grove in Oahu Hawaii_

_Find out what is CLCO later_

_An Ape sitting on the palm tree dropped a paper sheet._

_It was a list of ingredients. It turned out to be a recipe for a cake_

_He read the recipe and said wow! this is what I wanted_

_He got some ingredients himself from the store_

_And some from cloud island by calling his mom_

_She sent it through cookie monster_

_This cake has six layer top cloud icing_

_The base is special cloud leaf made of C12H22O11 mould_ xdhclfhf
